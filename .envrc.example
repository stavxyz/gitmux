# .envrc - direnv configuration for this project
# Copy this file to .envrc and customize for your environment
# direnv automatically loads these variables, which Claude Code will then see
#
# CRITICAL: This file (.envrc) is in .gitignore for a reason!
# NEVER commit .envrc to version control, even if you think it contains no secrets.
#
# Quick setup:
#   cp .envrc.example .envrc
#   direnv allow
#   just setup

# Python virtual environment
# Uncomment to automatically activate your venv when entering this directory
# layout python python3

# Or use explicit path activation:
# source_env_if_exists .venv/bin/activate

# Claude Code Model Configuration
# The project default is "opus" (Claude Opus 4.5 for all operations)
# Uncomment one of these to override the default model for your local environment:
#
# export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="opus"        # Opus 4.5 for all operations (default, maximum quality)
# export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="opusplan"    # Hybrid: Opus for planning, Sonnet for execution (balanced)
# export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="sonnet"      # Sonnet 4.5 for all operations (faster, cost-effective)
# export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="haiku"       # Haiku for simple tasks (fastest, most economical)
#
# Note: Default is Opus for maximum quality. Override only if speed/cost is a concern.
# You can also use /model <name> in a Claude Code session to switch models temporarily

# Example: Project-specific environment variables
# export PROJECT_NAME="persuade"
# export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# Example: API-related *non-secret* configuration
# WARNING: Do NOT export real API keys here - .envrc is loaded into your environment
#          and may be exposed in logs, process listings, or command output.
#          Use a secrets manager or carefully scoped mechanism for actual secrets.
# export ANTHROPIC_API_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com"

# Example: Development settings
# export DEBUG="true"
# export PYTEST_TIMEOUT="300"

# Example: Tool-specific configuration
# export RUFF_CACHE_DIR="${PWD}/.ruff_cache"
# export MYPY_CACHE_DIR="${PWD}/.mypy_cache"

# Note: direnv sources this file when you cd into the project
# Keep it fast - avoid slow operations in .envrc that would slow down directory changes

# GitHub host (for GitHub Enterprise)
# export GH_HOST="github.com"

# GitHub owner for test repository creation

# GitHub token (required for integration tests and -s/-c/-z flags)
# WARNING: Never commit tokens! Use a secrets manager or pass via environment.
# export GH_TOKEN="ghp_..."
